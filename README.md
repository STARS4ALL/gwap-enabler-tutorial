This tutorial will guide new adopters to customize and adapt the [GWAP-enabler framework](https://github.com/STARS4ALL/gwap-enabler) to a new use case. 
The goal of this tutorial is twofold; on the one hand, we provide developers with a guided example of an “instantiation” of our framework; on the other hand, we demonstrate how this GWAP Enabler could be used and adapted to build a crowdsourcing web application to enrich and reﬁne OpenStreetMap data and, consequently, its linked data version LinkedGeoData), in which users are motivated to participate through fun incentives.

In particular the tutorial explains how build a new GWAP that aims to classify OpenStreetMap restaurants on the basis of the type of cuisine.
Following the [wiki pages](https://github.com/STARS4ALL/gwap-enabler-tutorial/wiki) you will be able to implement step-by-step your GWAP in only few hours.
